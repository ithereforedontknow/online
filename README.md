## Features ‚ú®

The primary functionalities and architectural elements of the project include:

* Exposes a **RESTful API** (in `api/`).
* Serves frontend assets and a public-facing interface (in `public/`).
* **PDF generation** using the **FPDF** library (found in `fpdf/`).
* Handles queue management or background processing via a dedicated script (`queue.php`).
* Manages configurable settings (in `config/`).

---

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

* **PHP** (core backend and API logic)
* **JavaScript** (frontend scripts)
* **FPDF** library for PDF output
* Web server (Apache / Nginx) and a functional PHP environment
* Database (if configured)

## Directory Structure üìÇ

A brief overview of the key folders and files:

| Directory/File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `api/` | PHP files containing all **API endpoints**. |
| `public/` | Web-accessible frontend files (CSS, JS, images). **This should be your document root.** |
| `views/` | Server-rendered HTML templates. |
| `config/` | Application configuration files (database, app settings, etc.). |
| `includes/` | Shared PHP code, helper functions, and classes. |
| `fpdf/` | The **FPDF** library files. |
| `queue.php` | The main script for running **background tasks** and job queue management. |

---

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

Ensure you have the following installed on your development or production environment:

* **PHP:** A version compatible with `composer.json` dependencies.
* **Composer:** For dependency management.
* **Web Server:** Apache or Nginx configured to serve the **`public/`** directory.
* **(Optional)** **Database** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) if required by the application.
* **Permissions:** Write permissions for directories used for logs, caches, or generated PDFs.

## Configuration üîë

Inside `config/`, you'll find settings such as:

* Database connection details.
* Application settings and constants.
* API keys (if any).
* PDF generation settings.

You may need to set **environment variables** or use an `.env` file (if supported by your setup) to securely override default settings.
PDF Generation

PDFs are generated via the methods provided in the code, leveraging the functionality of FPDF.

Scripts / Commands

    queue.php: Executes and manages background processing jobs.

    index.php: The bootstrap file for the frontend and main routing logic.

    Additional CLI or web scripts may exist in api/ or includes/.
